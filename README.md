Install
-------

Install it via `bower`.

```

```

Or, you can clone this repo and install it locally (you will need `npm`, of course).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:leodido/ng-date-elements.git
$ cd ng-date-elements/
$ npm install
```

Build
-----

Build is handled through [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/) and performed mainly via [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler).

Need help? Run `gulp help` !

```
# Usage
#   gulp [task]

To build a development version (logging not disabled) of JS lib:

```
$ gulp build --env dev
```

Or, also:

```

```

```
$ npm run production
